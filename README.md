# Disease-Prediction
This project is a Disease Prediction System developed using Machine Learning (ML) techniques and Python programming. The main goal of the project is to help people detect diseases early based on their symptoms, medical history, or other health data. Early detection can save time, reduce risk, and improve treatment outcomes.
